Ex1: The Button

- This is a basic play button.
- You need to add a class to #the-btn to make it disapear when it is clicked.

Your job is to write the js necassary to:

1. Store #the-btn element into a variable.
2. Attach an event to it (on click). The event should:
   -> 2.1 Add the class "hidden" to the element.
   -> 2.2 Log a msg in the console to notify the player that the game has started.
3. (Bonus):
   -> Create a div with id="game" filling the screen with a bg color of black.
   -> The #game should be hidden at the start.
   -> When #the-btn is clicked, remove the class hidden from #game.

Some things you might want to google or ChatGpt:

- document.querySelector(string)
- addEventListener(string, callback)
- classList.add(string)
- console.log(string)
